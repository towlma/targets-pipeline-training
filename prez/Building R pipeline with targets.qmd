## Objective of the training

During this training, you will learn :

-   to build robust R pipeline using [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)

-   to run and visualize [targets](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) pipeline

-   to use static branching and dynamic branching

-   to perform data quality checks with [assertr](https://github.com/ropensci/assertr)

-   to create log files with [log4r](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/log4r/readme/README.html)

## What is targets ?

The R package `targets` is a powerful tool for **managing and automating data analysis and modeling pipelines**. It helps streamline the workflow by automatically **tracking dependencies** between code and data, ensuring that only necessary steps are rerun when inputs change.

## Why use targets ? (acc. to chatGPT)

1.  **Dependency Management**: 'targets' helps you clearly specify dependencies between different parts of your analysis pipeline. This makes it easier to understand the flow of data and computations in your project.

2.  **Incremental Updates**: When input data or code changes, 'targets' intelligently identifies and updates only the affected downstream tasks. This saves time and computational resources by avoiding unnecessary re-execution of unchanged steps.

## Why use targets ? (acc. to chatGPT)

3.  **Parallel and Distributed Computing**: 'targets' supports parallel and distributed computing, which can significantly speed up the execution of computationally intensive tasks. This is especially valuable for large datasets or complex models.

4.  **Reproducibility**: The package enhances reproducibility by capturing a complete record of your workflow, including the specific versions of data, code, and packages used for each task. This makes it easier to reproduce and share your analysis.

## Why use targets ? (acc. to chatGPT)

5.  **Modularity and Flexibility**: The package encourages a modular approach to organizing your analysis, allowing you to break down complex workflows into smaller, more manageable tasks. This can improve code maintainability and collaboration.

Overall, `targets` simplifies and optimizes the management of data analysis and modeling pipelines, making your workflow more efficient, reproducible, and easier to maintain, while also offering the potential for significant time savings in data-intensive tasks.

## Going further

`gittargets` package captures version-controlled snapshots of the data store, and each snapshot links to the underlying commit of the source code
